# Brick-Breaker

Terminal Based Brick Breaker Game

1. Game Starts. Move Paddle with 'a' to go left and 'd' to go right. Release ball with 'w'.

2. Red Bricks have strength 3, yellow have strength 2, green have strength 1, grey are unbreakable and purple are explosive (destroy adjacent/diagonal bricks)

3. 10 points added per brick broken

4. Each round has 3 lives. Lives get lost when the ball is missed by the paddle.

5. Upon destroying a block, there is a chance of a powerup spawning. Catch the powerups with your paddle to activate them. There are 4 powerups. Expand Paddle (increases paddle length), Shrink Paddle (decreases paddle length), Fast Ball (increases ball velocity) and Through Ball (passes through and destroys all bricks that come in the way).

6. Game ends when all lives are lost or you can press 'x' to end game
